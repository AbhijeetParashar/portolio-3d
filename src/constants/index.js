    testimonial: `Abhijeet and I have been working together for more than 5 years now. He is the UI Lead and I am the QA Lead in the same squad. Abhijeet has consistently been delivering stories assigned to him either early or in time, with minimal to zero bugs. Abhjeet has managed to give one time permanent fix to all the bugs assigned to him, meaning they can be closed in a single retest. I have seen Abhijeet guiding other developers on complex fixes required to resolve a bug. Abhijeet readily takes on additional tasks when someone is unavailable. I have also seen Abhijeet providing innovative solutions in tech grooming sessions. He is also open to enhancements and change requests the come up during testing. Abhijeet is highly knowledged and a quick learner. He single handedly knows the nook and corner of the application that is currently being built from scratch. He also coordinates well with backend developers, QA and BA. As a QA, I have a level of confidence on the solutions developed by him. He is a core member of the squad and personally, a kind-hearted person.`,
